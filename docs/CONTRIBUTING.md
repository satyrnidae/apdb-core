## Plugin or Product Change

The goal of the Another Pluggable Discord Bot project is to be as modular as possible.  `apdb-api` and `apdb-core` are lightweight modules which provide only the bare minimum of functionality, streamlining plugin development and actually executing the bot's core functionality.

But how can you tell if a feature would be better suited for the main bot or a plugin?

If the feature introduces new commands, or new events, or is otherwise not related to providing the bare minimum of guild setting control or plugin development streamlining, consider creating or requesting a new plugin.  Otherwise, go ahead with your change or request; we'll let you know what we'll do with it!

## Submitting Issues and Other Requests

Found a bug, but not a coder?  Or have you already fixed the bug, and now need to merge it to the main codebase?  It's time to submit an issue!

### Questions

[Submit a question](https://github.com/satyrnidae/apdb-api/issues/new?assignees=satyrnidae&labels=question&template=question.md)

If your issue is just a quick question, such as clarification on docs or setup woes, please see the above section on [quick questions](#quick-questions).

### Issues / Bug Reports

[Submit a new bug report](https://github.com/satyrnidae/apdb-api/issues/new?assignees=satyrnidae&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md)

Issue reports should be concise but thorough.  Include a short description of the problem, what you were doing when the issue occurred, and any steps to take to reproduce the issue.  There is an issue template available, and while you don't necessarily have to fill out all of the information present in the template, following it and providing any information you can will be a massive help to the person looking into the issue.  Be sure to mark your issue with the `bug` label to make it easier to find in the issue list.

### Feature requests

[Submit a new feature request](https://github.com/satyrnidae/apdb-api/issues/new?assignees=satyrnidae&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md)

Feature requests are welcome!  A template is available for feature requests.  Be sure to be specific with your request.

### Pull requests

[Create a pull request](https://github.com/satyrnidae/apdb-api/compare)

Before code can be merged to the `master` branch it must be reviewed by a valid code owner.  Use the template to automatically notify the code owner of your pull request.

**Thanks for reading, and happy contributing!**
